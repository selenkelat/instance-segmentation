The dataset includes 146 images.
Guitar-piano-trumpet-bVBV are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Randomly crop between 0 and 40 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -27 and +27 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -43 and +43 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
